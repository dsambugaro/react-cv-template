                My first "Hello World" was during high school, around 2012. Since then I have been learning a lot and I'll learn even more, I hope. I'm a big Linux enthusiast, the same for Open Source projects. Being a little bit Maker, I like to play around with Raspberry Pi, Arduino, ESP32 and other microcontrollers for personal projects.
